        <b>Project Information: </b>
        Our goal for this project was to expand on our second mini project to provide an in-depth analysis of the drug overdose deaths in Connecticut. For this project, one thing we want to be sure to implement is showing how overdoses vary across the different counties in Connecticut:
        Litchfield, Hartford, Tolland, Windham, Fairfield, New Haven, Middlesex, and New London. We decided to take advantage of the extensive amount of demographic variables in our dataset to highlight the trends and differences in overdoses across counties. Striving for aesthetics, functionality
        and insightfulness, we decided to utilize two bar graphs and a bubble map with a selection button, which allows for interactivity. Through our visualizations, we were able to conclude that heroin, fentanyl, and opoids were the most prominent drugs in OD cases in all the counties and 
        males were more likely to OD then females in all counties.

        <b>Design and Implementation: </b>
        We started out with a quick sketch to plan out how we want to design and arrange our visualizations on the webpage. We decided to use a button that will allow users to select one of the 6 counties, with "All counties" being the default state. Clicking the county will prompt the two corresponding bar
        graphs, "Drug types" and "Gender", to transition depending on the data of the selected county. Both bar graphs are plotted against "Number of overdoses" on the y-axis. We wanted to do an interactive bubble map for our third visualization, and because the data for race was rather small, we decided it would be 
        the best idea, visually and functionally, to have it seperate from the selection button and just display the data of all counties, which we labelled. We were able to easily implement and put together all of this through Github because we met up and worked on the project, discussed, wrote code, and submitted together.
